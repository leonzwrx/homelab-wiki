## General plugin info - current setup

- vim-plug is the current plugin manager: 		https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

- ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim
Purpose: This file is the core of vim-plug. It contains the code necessary for managing pluginsâ€”installing, updating, and loading them.
How it works: When you call `plug#begin()` and `plug#end()` in your .vimrc, plug.vim handles these commands and manages your plugins accordingly.

- ~/.vim/plugged
Purpose: This directory is where vim-plug installs and stores all the plugins you specify in your .vimrc.
How it works: When you use Plug 'plugin/repo' in your .vimrc and run `:PlugInstall`, vim-plug clones the specified repositories into the ~/.vim/plugged directory.
Management: This directory is automatically populated and managed by vim-plug, based on the plugins you list in your configuration.


- FOR WINDOWS: manually download the plug.vim file from vim-plug GitHub and place it in the C:\Users<YourUsername>\vimfiles\autoload\ directory.
Then, modify _vimrc file to call the Plugins


- Adding Plugins: Add the Plug 'username/repo' lines to your .vimrc within the `plug#begin()` and `plug#end()` block.
Installing Plugins: Run `:PlugInstall` in Vim.
Cleaning Up Plugins: Run `:PlugClean` in Vim to remove any plugins no longer listed in your .vimrc.
- Updating Plugins: Run `:PlugUpdate` in Vim.
For automatic updates, add this to .vimrc
`autocmd VimEnter * PlugUpdate --sync | source $MYVIMRC`
- To See status:
`:PlugStatus`
